# NavAble
We often take for granted the little privileges we don’t realise aren’t available to everyone.
As a sighted person, navigation comes easy. Most public spaces have ample signs and
instructions that can be used to find the route to go to our destination. However, such
facilities are not accessible to the visually impaired. Signs, even in braille, are difficult to read
unless they have specific instructions at short intervals. Canes and tactile markings are also of
little help with the lack of maintenance present in most public spaces. One such space would
be a railway station. Railway stations on any day are usually packed with people, always in a
hurry and often busy with thoughts of their travel. In such a mindset, they are not often able
to pay attention to other passengers on the station. In such a situation, it can be very difficult
for a visibly impaired to navigate such an environment which can be incredibly challenging.
They can easily bump into objects or people, get hurt or get lost. While they usually take help
from a sighted person who guides them through this task, it is still not entirely feasible for
them to be able to do it often. They must depend on this sighted person and account for them
while making plans. They are heavily dependent on this person who is not a very comfortable
position. In order to make this basic task easier for them and give them the chance to be
independent travelers, we intend to make a Railway Navigation App for the visually impaired
called ‘NAVable’.
